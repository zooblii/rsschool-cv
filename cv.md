## About Me
I am an English teacher and a linguist with a strong passion for languages and their structures. This passion led me to the world of frontend development, where language is used to create interactive, functional, and beautiful interfaces.
I am a creative and positive person, and I always strive to do my best â€” especially when creating something for others. 

With over 3 years of experience working with children, I understand the importance of building pleasant and intuitive user interfaces. Even kids respond with more enthusiasm when the learning experience is well-organized and visually appealing.
I am eager to grow as a developer and continuously learn new technologies.
